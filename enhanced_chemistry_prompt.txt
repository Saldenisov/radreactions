You are an expert data cleaner. You will receive the full contents of a TSV (tab-delimited) text file representing 7-column rows of chemistry data. This file will be used later to generate LaTeX, so all LaTeX/mhchem content must remain valid.

Output/format constraints

Return ONLY the corrected file contents. No commentary, no code fences.

Use the TAB character (\t) as the column delimiter in the output. Do NOT change the delimiter to commas or semicolons.

Each row must have exactly 7 columns in the order:
ID<TAB>Name<TAB>Reaction<TAB>pH<TAB>Rate<TAB>Comments<TAB>Reference.

If a row has fewer than 7 columns, append empty cells until there are 7.

If a line starts with tabs or has fewer than 3 fields (no ID/Name/Reaction), treat it as a continuation row belonging to the most recent complete entry. For continuation rows, leave columns 1–3 empty (tabs only) and fill only columns 4–7.

LaTeX/mhchem rules

Every chemical formula or reaction must be wrapped in $\ce{...}$.

Reactions: wrap the entire reaction (reactants, arrows, products) in \ce{}. Keep arrows as written (->, <=>, \rightleftharpoons).

Standalone formulas: replace math-mode forms with \ce{}. Examples:

FeSO$_4$ → $\ce{FeSO4}$

O$_2$ → $\ce{O2}$

HClO$_4$ → $\ce{HClO4}$

ClOH$^-$ → $\ce{ClOH^-}$

H$^+$ → $\ce{H^+}$

Cl$^\cdot$ → $\ce{Cl^.}$

Cl$_2^{-\cdot}$ → $\ce{Cl2^{-.}}$

Radicals: use ^., e.g. $\ce{^.OH}$, $\ce{Cl^.}$.

Parenthetical formulas: wrap them, e.g. (Cl$_2^-$) → ($\ce{Cl2^-}$).

Kinetics notation: if k(...) contains chemistry, wrap only the inside. Examples:

k(Cl$^\cdot$ + Cl$^-$) → $k(\ce{Cl^. + Cl^-})$

rel. to k(^.OH + EtOH) → rel. to $k(\ce{^.OH + EtOH})$

Do not wrap standalone variables (k, K, K_eq) or pure numbers.

Decision rules

If it looks like chemistry (elements, charges, radicals, subscripts/superscripts), wrap it in \ce{}.

If it contains species and connectors (+, ->, <=>, etc.), wrap the entire reaction.

Prefer wrapping as chemistry rather than leaving raw math.

Do not change

Non-chemistry math (e.g. $4.3 \times 10^9$).

Units, plain text, or column order.

Output: the corrected TSV file with only the chemistry cleaned into valid \ce{} form.
