# RadReactions

An open platform for curated radiation radical reaction data.

RadReactions digitizes, curates, validates, and publishes rate constants for aqueous radical reactions, initially derived from the Buxton Critical Review (DOI: 10.1063/1.555805). It provides:
- A Streamlit application for collaborative validation over table images
- A normalized SQLite database with full‑text search (FTS5)
- Reproducible artifacts (TSV, LaTeX, PDF) generated from source tables

## What’s in this repo
- app/: Streamlit UI, data import, database access, utilities
- data-full/: Versioned dataset (images, CSV/TSV, LaTeX/PDF, validation_db.json) — tracked via Git LFS
- ops/: Deployment and operations (Dockerfile, Compose, Railway config, scripts)

## Key features
- End‑to‑end pipeline: images → TSV → LaTeX → PDF → SQLite
- Collaborative validation tracked per image (validation_db.json)
- Idempotent TSV imports that keep the DB in sync
- Canonicalization of reaction formulas for robust search/deduplication
- Fast FTS search by name/formula/notes across tables 5–9
- Transparent provenance: each reaction references its source file

## Quick start (local)
Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, LaTeX/XeLaTeX

```
pip install -r ops/requirements.txt
streamlit run app/main_app.py
```

The app auto‑discovers the dataset under `data-full`. Override with `BASE_DIR` if you keep data elsewhere.

## Deploy
See ops/README.md for Docker and Railway deployment.

## Data model (high level)
- reactions: table number, category, canonical/latex formula, name/notes, source path, validation metadata
- measurements: pH, temperature, rate (raw and parsed), units, method/conditions, reference link
- references_map: Buxton codes and DOIs

## Roadmap (suggested)
- DOI resolution and status enrichment
- Expand beyond tables 5–9
- Public API for programmatic queries
- Provenance and versioned DB releases
